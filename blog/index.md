# Let's start with a story based off a joke...
*knock knock* [Came a sound from the door]

[You look up from your book, confused. You hesitantly say,] Who's there?

**KBG** [Came the reply]

[You immediatly relax. You understand the format, as this was a childhood game you and your friends would play.] KBG who?

**Ve vill ask the questions!** [You jump as they shout, but laugh. You recognize that voice, with the fake accent and corny jokes.]

James! [You shout getting up. You open the door, and there he is. Your best friend.]

[He laughs, hugging you.] **Long time no see!**
